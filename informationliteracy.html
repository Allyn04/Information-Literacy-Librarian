      <h2>What is Information Literacy?</h2>
      <p>
        Information literacy is the ability to find, evaluate, and use information effectively. It is not just about searching on Google, but about knowing where to look, how to judge what’s real or fake, and how to use information ethically and responsibly. In today’s digital world, where so much information is available online, information literacy helps us avoid fake news, plagiarism, and misinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It involves skills like identifying a research need, choosing the right sources (books, articles, databases), checking credibility, citing correctly, and thinking critically. This skill is very important for students, teachers, researchers, and even parents.

      <h2>My Role as an Information Literacy Librarian</h2>
      <p>
        As a future Information Literacy Librarian, my main job is to guide users — especially students — in becoming smart, confident, and responsible users of information. I help others learn how to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Search for trustworthy and reliable sources online or in the library</li>
        <li>Understand how to avoid plagiarism by citing sources properly</li>
        <li>Recognize fake or biased information on the internet</li>
        <li>Use online databases, library catalogues, and academic resources</li>
        <li>Apply critical thinking when using digital content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I don’t just give answers — I teach people how to find their own answers, and that’s a powerful skill for life.

      <h2>How This Website Supports Information Literacy</h2>
      <p>
        This website was designed not just to introduce who I am, but also to serve as a digital space where users can learn more about information literacy. It includes simple navigation, clear explanations, and a friendly interface — so that even beginners can benefit from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe librarians today are not just working with books, but are part of the digital journey of every learner. That’s why I created this platform — to support, guide, and connect with those who want to become better information users.
